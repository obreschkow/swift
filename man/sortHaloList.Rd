None. Modifies `swift$halos` in place.

\description{
Sorts the halo list from most to least massive, ensuring that each central halo is followed by its associated satellite halos.
}
\details{
The input halo table (`swift$halos`) is sorted so that more massive centrals appear earlier, followed by their satellites ordered by subhalo rank. The function also updates `HostHaloIndex` and computes `NumberOfSubhalos` for each central. The variable `halos` is locally bound via an active binding to refer to `swift$halos` directly.
